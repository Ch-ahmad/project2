        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>Photography</h3>
   <ul>
    <p>Photography has always been one of my favourite hobbies. From working as media head for school events to capturing the beauty of nature through lens, from photography I realized that getting a different view of things means you have
        a more open mind to the world. Which is why itâ€™s always been my favourite hobby.</p>
   </ul>

    <h3>Cricket</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Cricket has always been my most favourite sports to play and watch. In countiries like Pakistan and India crickets is very popular. From my childhood i have been playing cricket in garage and streets and during my high-school.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>E-sports</h3>
   <ul>
    <p>For last 4-5 years I have spend alot of my free time playing e-games. First Person Shooter(FPS) games have always been my favourite. Recently I have been playing PUBG Mobile alot and partcicpated in a few tournaments with my team. Its a good
        thing to do as it helps in enhancing the focusing ability.</p>
